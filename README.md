# card-game-maker

[NOT complete project] Showcase of my parts in a 8-person project to create a card game maker in Java (with JavaFX) from scratch. Files within this repo are one that I directly contributed to and/or created for the project. Total expected hours working on this project was around 30 hr/week. 

Includes full video demonstration of how the program works. 

Main contributions to the project: worked on the builder side of the program. Built most aspects of the builder (frontend and backend logic to string together the information) and the login/home screens (frontend and backend logic up to connection to Google Firebase). Primary focus was on user data collection and storage (less focused on frontend) and creating the data pipeline for information bundles to be processed into a JSON file.
